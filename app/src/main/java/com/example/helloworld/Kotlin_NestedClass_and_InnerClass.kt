//Nested Class is such a class which is created inside another class.
// In Kotlin, a nested class is by default static, so its data members and members can be accessed without creating an object of the class.
// It cannot access the data members of outer classes.

// Inner class is a nested class which is marked as "inner".
// Inner class cannot be declared inside interfaces or non-inner nested classes.
// The advantage of inner class over nested class is that, it is able to access members of its outer class even it is private.

// The inner class have a reference of object of outer class
